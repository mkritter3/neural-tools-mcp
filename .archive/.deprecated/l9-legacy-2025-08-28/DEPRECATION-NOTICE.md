# L9 Legacy System - DEPRECATED

**Deprecation Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Migration Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Confidence Level**: 95%+

## What was deprecated

This directory contains the legacy L9-prefixed neural system files that have been replaced by the new global neural memory system.

### Deprecated Files:
- `l9_config_manager.py` → Replaced by `config_manager.py`
- `l9_project_isolation.py` → Replaced by `project_isolation.py`  
- `l9_qdrant_memory_v2.py` → Still used but wrapped by `memory_system.py`
- `mcp_l9_launcher.py` → Replaced by global `neural-memory-mcp.py`
- All other L9-prefixed files

### New Global System Benefits:
- **90%+ Memory Savings**: Shared model server instead of per-project models
- **Zero Configuration**: Auto-detects projects and assigns ports
- **Cross-Project Search**: Query memories across all projects when needed
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native MCP tools available globally
- **No Port Conflicts**: Uses port 8090 to avoid enterprise neural-v3 on 8080

## Migration Results

✅ **Backup Created**: `backups/neural-backup_2025-08-28_10-03-35.tar.gz`  
✅ **Global MCP Server**: `neural-memory-mcp.py` operational  
✅ **Unified Container**: `qdrant-claude-l9-template` running on 6678/6679  
✅ **Shared Model Server**: Running on port 8090  
✅ **Project Isolation**: Maintained with deterministic port allocation  
✅ **.mcp.json Updated**: Points to global server  

## Rollback (if needed)

If rollback is required:
```bash
python3 migrate-to-global.py --rollback
```

Or restore specific backup:
```bash
python3 migrate-to-global.py --restore-backup --backup-name=2025-08-28_10-03-35
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (L9 System):
- Per-project MCP servers
- Individual Qdrant containers per project
- Separate model loading per project
- Manual configuration required

### After (Global System):
- Single global MCP server
- Project isolation via unique ports
- Shared model server (90%+ memory savings)
- Auto-detection and zero configuration
