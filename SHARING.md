## For Claude Users

The MCP server is pre-configured. Once setup completes, you'll have these tools available in Claude:

- `semantic_code_search()` - Search by meaning
- `graphrag_hybrid_search()` - Hybrid search with graph context
- `project_understanding()` - Get project overview
- `neural_system_status()` - Check system health

## Optional: Global Installation

Want neural-tools available in ALL your projects?

```bash
./scripts/install-global-mcp.sh
```

## Support

- Check `docs/adr/` for architecture decisions
- Run `docker-compose logs -f` for debugging
- Ensure Docker has at least 4GB memory allocated
