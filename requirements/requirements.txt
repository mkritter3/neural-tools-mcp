# Neural Flow MCP Server Requirements (Preloaded Version)
# Python 3.13+ compatible versions
# Optimized for <50ms query performance with model pre-loading

# Core MCP server framework
mcp>=1.13.1

# Neural embeddings and vector database
chromadb>=1.0.20  # Must be 1.0.20+ for NumPy 2.x compatibility
numpy>=2.1.0      # Required for Python 3.13
onnxruntime>=1.20.1
tiktoken>=0.9.0

# AsyncIO support for MCP server
asyncio-mqtt>=0.16.0  # Optional, for MQTT support

# Development dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0
# black>=23.0.0
# mypy>=1.0.0

# Performance Notes:
# - Preloaded server uses ~300MB RAM but provides <50ms response times
# - First-time startup takes 2-3 seconds to pre-load models
# - Falls back gracefully if pre-loading fails

# Python 3.13 Compatibility:
# - NumPy must be >=2.1.0 
# - ChromaDB must be >=1.0.20 (earlier versions incompatible with NumPy 2.x)
# - Some packages may show pip resolver warnings but will work correctly
