---

### **PHASE 2: SEMANTIC FOUNDATIONS** (2-6 months)

#### Gap #2 - AST-Aware Chunking
- **Action**: Implement **cAST algorithm** using existing Tree-sitter AST analyzer
- **Location**: Replace line-based chunking in `ProjectNeuralIndexer._chunk_file_content()` in `.claude/mcp-tools/project_neural_indexer.py`
- **Research Backing**: cAST paper demonstrates 40-60% retrieval improvement
- **Method**: 
  - Parse code into AST using existing Tree-sitter integration
  - Apply "split-then-merge" recursive algorithm for optimal chunk boundaries
  - Preserve function/class/method boundaries as atomic units
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Per-language node selection policies (function/method/class as atomic chunks)
  - Merge adjacent small nodes under min_tokens threshold
  - Split mega-functions by logical blocks with overlap
  - Robust fallback to existing chunking when AST parsing fails

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ≥20-40% lift in code retrieval tasks (symbol lookup, implementation search)
- No >25% increase in index size without commensurate gains
- Robust handling of all supported programming languages

#### Gap #5 - Cross-Domain Bridge  
- **Action**: Add domain tagging to existing ChromaDB collections
- **Location**: Extend metadata in both memory and project systems
- **Method**: 
  - Add domain tags ('memory', 'project', 'code', 'conversation') to existing metadata
  - Implement unified search interface preserving existing storage
  - Enable cross-collection semantic search with score normalization
- **Research Backing**: HybridRAG techniques proven effective for cross-domain retrieval

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extend existing metadata schemas with domain classification
- Implement QueryBroker for parallel cross-domain searches  
- Score normalization (z-score per domain) with domain-specific weighting
- Late fusion of results from multiple collections

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Mixed queries (discussion → code, code → discussion) show measurable improvement
- Cross-domain search maintains latency within existing SLO
- Preserves all existing functionality

---

### **PHASE 3: TEMPORAL INTELLIGENCE** (6-12 months)

#### Gap #4 - Code Evolution Tracking
- **Action**: Integrate git log data into existing metadata tables
- **Location**: Replace filesystem mtime placeholders in `project_neural_indexer.py:244-251`

- **Method**:
  - Parse git commit graph per repository 
  - Extract commit timestamps, author data, modification frequency
  - Implement freshness scoring with exponential decay
  - Add deprecation detection based on file lifecycle patterns

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Source-of-truth: commit DAG per repo (default branch initially)
- Ingestion pipeline detects changed files from last indexed commit
- Run AST chunking only on impacted files; delete stale chunks by symbol_id
- Store commit hash, author, timestamps, lines added/deleted in metadata

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Reduced indexing time proportional to change scope (not full re-index)
- Freshness scoring correlates with user engagement metrics
- Ability to distinguish active vs legacy/deprecated code patterns

### **PHASE 4: UNIFIED EXPERIENCE** (12-18 months)

- Keep current databases; add orchestration layer with comprehensive metrics
- Optional lightweight structural graph (imports, calls, includes) in SQLite

**Acceptance Criteria**:
