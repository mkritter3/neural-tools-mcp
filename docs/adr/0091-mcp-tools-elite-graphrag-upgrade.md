# ADR-0091: MCP Tools Elite GraphRAG Upgrade

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** September 23, 2025
**Author:** Claude with Grok 4 Expert Analysis
**Tags:** MCP Tools, GraphRAG, Neo4j 2025.08.0, Nomic Embed v2

## Context

After implementing ADR-0090's elite GraphRAG capabilities (HNSW optimization, USES/INSTANTIATES relationships, graph fan-out), our MCP tools need updates to leverage these enhancements. Grok 4 analysis revealed:

1. Current `semantic_search` tool uses old `hybrid_search()` method, missing graph fan-out
2. No tool exposes the new `hybrid_search_with_fanout()` capability
3. `dependency_analysis` doesn't leverage USES/INSTANTIATES relationships
4. Need dedicated elite search for maximum context retrieval

## Decision

Create a modular upgrade path that preserves backward compatibility while enabling elite GraphRAG features.

## Implementation

### 1. New Tool: elite_search.py (✅ Created)

**Purpose:** Dedicated tool for maximum context retrieval using graph fan-out

```python
# Always uses hybrid_search_with_fanout
results = await neo4j.hybrid_search_with_fanout(
    query_text=query,
    query_embedding=embedding,
    max_depth=2,  # 1-3 hops configurable
    limit=10,
    vector_weight=0.7  # 70% vector, 30% graph
)
```

**Features:**
- DRIFT-inspired graph traversal
- Rich context with explanations
- Tracks imports, calls, variables, classes
- 15-minute cache TTL (shorter due to richness)

**When to Use:**
- Complex code understanding queries
- Debugging with context needs
- Architecture exploration
- Relationship-heavy searches

### 2. Update: semantic_search.py (Pending)

**Current:** Uses `neo4j.hybrid_search()` (basic vector + text)

**Proposed Changes:**
```python
# Add search_level parameter
"search_level": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["basic", "elite"],
    "default": "basic",
    "description": "Basic: fast vector+text | Elite: graph fan-out with context"
}

# Implementation
if search_level == "elite" and mode == "hybrid":
    results = await neo4j.hybrid_search_with_fanout(...)
else:
    results = await neo4j.hybrid_search(...)  # Existing
```

**Benefits:**
- Backward compatible
- User chooses performance vs context
- Gradual migration path

### 3. Update: dependency_analysis.py (Pending)

**Current:** Only tracks IMPORTS and basic CALLS

**Proposed Enhancements:**
```python
# Add relationship type filter
"relationship_types": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "enum": ["IMPORTS", "CALLS", "USES", "INSTANTIATES", "INHERITS"]
    },
    "default": ["IMPORTS", "CALLS"]
}

# Show variable usage patterns
if "USES" in relationship_types:
    # Track which variables are commonly used together
    variable_patterns = analyze_variable_usage()

# Track instantiation chains
if "INSTANTIATES" in relationship_types:
    # Show class instantiation hierarchy
    instantiation_chain = trace_instantiations()
```

## Neo4j 2025.08.0 Best Practices

Based on Grok 4 research and testing:

### HNSW Index Configuration (Already Implemented)
```cypher
CREATE VECTOR INDEX chunk_embeddings_index IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Chunk) ON c.embedding
OPTIONS {
  indexConfig: {
    `vector.dimensions`: 768,
    `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine',
    `vector.hnsw.m`: 24,  -- Increased from 16
    `vector.hnsw.ef_construction`: 150,  -- Increased from 100
    `vector.quantization.enabled`: true,  -- 2x speed with int8
    `vector.quantization.type`: 'int8'
  }
}
```

### Query Optimization
```cypher
-- Use db.index.vector.queryNodes for HNSW search
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('chunk_embeddings_index', $k, $embedding)
YIELD node, score
WHERE node.project = $project  -- Project isolation
```

### Connection Pooling
- Pool size: 50 (conservative for complex queries)
- Min connections: 5
- Connection timeout: 5000ms
- Idle timeout: 30000ms

### Caching Strategy
- Semantic queries: 30 minutes
- Structural queries: 1 hour
- Elite search: 15 minutes (rich context changes frequently)

## Nomic Embed v2 Configuration

Grok 4 recommends staying with Nomic Embed v2 for stability:

### Current Setup (Keep)
- Model: Nomic Embed v2
- Dimensions: 768
- Max tokens: 8192
- Batch size: 32

### Task Prefixes (ADR-0084)
```python
# Optimize embeddings by task
task_prefixes = {
    "search_query": "search_query: ",
    "search_document": "search_document: ",
    "classification": "classification: ",
    "clustering": "clustering: "
}
```

### Future Migration Path (Q4 2025)
Consider Nomic Embed Code 7B when:
- Need better code-specific understanding
- Can handle model migration complexity
- Have benchmarked performance gains

## Performance Expectations

### Elite Search (elite_search.py)
- Latency: <150ms with graph context
- Recall@10: >85%
- Context richness: 10x standard search

### Enhanced Semantic Search
- Basic mode: <50ms (unchanged)
- Elite mode: <150ms (new capability)

### Dependency Analysis
- With USES/INSTANTIATES: +20ms
- Richer insights: 3x more relationships

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Performance degradation with deep traversal
**Mitigation:** Limit max_depth to 3, use caching aggressively

### Risk: Breaking changes to existing tools
**Mitigation:** Add optional parameters, maintain defaults

### Risk: Increased complexity
**Mitigation:** Modular design, clear mode separation

## Implementation Priority

1. **✅ Complete:** Create elite_search.py tool
2. **High:** Update semantic_search with elite mode
3. **Medium:** Enhance dependency_analysis
4. **Low:** Performance monitoring dashboard

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```python
# Test elite_search with various depths
async def test_elite_search_depth():
    for depth in [1, 2, 3]:
        results = await elite_search(query="auth", max_depth=depth)
        assert results["graph_context"]["total_connections"] > 0
```

### Integration Tests
- Verify backward compatibility
- Benchmark performance differences
- Validate cache behavior

### Load Tests
- Concurrent elite searches
- Graph traversal at scale
- Memory usage monitoring

## Monitoring

Track via metrics:
- Elite search usage vs basic
- Average graph traversal depth
- Cache hit rates by tool
- Query latency P50/P95/P99

## Conclusion

This upgrade path provides elite GraphRAG capabilities while maintaining stability. The new `elite_search` tool delivers immediate value, while incremental updates to existing tools ensure smooth migration.

**Key Insight from Grok 4:** "Modularity over monoliths - new elite_search.py avoids feature creep in semantic_search while providing dedicated high-context retrieval."
