# ADR-0003: L9 Hybrid Search Architecture Mandate

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Deciders**: Engineering Team  
**Technical Story**: Systematic mandate for hybrid search architecture across all L9 neural tools to achieve maximum understanding and precision

## Context

After comprehensive analysis of the L9 neural-flow system, we identified a critical architectural principle: **semantic-only search lacks precision** while **keyword-only search lacks understanding**. The existing L9 system already contains a sophisticated hybrid search implementation (`l9_hybrid_search.py`) that achieves 85%+ accuracy through BM25 + semantic + AST pattern fusion.

## Current State Analysis

```
L9 Search Architecture Assessment:
├── EXISTING HYBRID SEARCH (l9_hybrid_search.py)
│   ├── BM25 keyword search engine (tf-idf, k1=1.5, b=0.75)
│   ├── Semantic vector search (Qodo-Embed-1.5B via ChromaDB)
│   ├── AST pattern matching (code structure awareness)
│   ├── Intelligent fusion with confidence weighting
│   └── 85%+ Recall@1 target accuracy
│
├── CURRENT TOOL LIMITATIONS
│   ├── neural_memory_search: Semantic-only (acceptable for memory)
│   ├── neural_project_search: Semantic-only (needs hybrid upgrade)
│   ├── Legacy tools missing: trace_dependencies, find_atomic_relations
│   └── No hybrid integration in MCP server tools
│
└── ARCHITECTURAL GAP
    ├── Excellent hybrid search engine exists but underutilized
    ├── Tools use semantic-only when hybrid would provide superior results
    └── Missing integration between existing hybrid engine and MCP tools
```

## Decision

**ARCHITECTURAL MANDATE**: All L9 neural tools MUST use hybrid search architecture (BM25 + semantic + AST patterns) except for memory systems which may use semantic-only for conversational context preservation.

## L9 Hybrid Search Architecture Principles

### Core Principle: Multi-Modal Intelligence
- **BM25 Component**: Precise keyword matching for technical terms, function names, exact matches
- **Semantic Component**: Conceptual understanding, similarity matching, natural language queries  
- **AST Pattern Component**: Code structure awareness, syntactic pattern recognition
- **Intelligent Fusion**: Confidence-weighted combination with search type awareness

### Exception: Memory Systems
- **neural_memory_search**: May use semantic-only for conversation context preservation
- **Rationale**: Memory requires semantic understanding of conversational flow, not precision matching

### Mandate: All Other Tools
- **neural_project_search**: MUST upgrade to hybrid
- **New atomic tools**: MUST use hybrid architecture
- **Legacy tool modernization**: MUST leverage existing hybrid engine

## UPDATED ROADMAP: Hybrid-First Architecture

## PHASE 1: Hybrid Search Integration Foundation

### 1.1 MCP Server Hybrid Integration
```
Priority 1: Integrate existing l9_hybrid_search.py into mcp_neural_server.py
├── Import L9HybridSearchEngine into MCP server
├── Initialize hybrid engine alongside existing neural systems
├── Create hybrid search tool registration pattern
└── Establish hybrid engine lifecycle management
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- Import `get_l9_hybrid_search()` into mcp_neural_server.py
- Add hybrid search initialization to server startup
- Create hybrid tool template for consistent integration
- Establish error handling and fallback patterns

### 1.2 Project Search Hybrid Upgrade  
```
Upgrade neural_project_search from semantic-only to hybrid:
├── Replace ChromaDB-only search with L9 hybrid engine
├── Maintain MCP tool signature compatibility
├── Add BM25 + AST pattern capabilities
└── Achieve 85%+ accuracy improvement
```

**Migration Strategy**:
- Preserve existing neural_project_search API
- Internal implementation uses L9HybridSearchEngine
- Add document indexing pipeline to populate BM25 + ChromaDB + AST patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing users

## PHASE 2: Modern L9 Atomic Tool Implementation

### 2.1 Hybrid-Powered Atomic Tools
**All new tools MUST use existing L9 hybrid search architecture**:

#### Tool 1: `neural_dependency_tracer` (Hybrid)
```python
async def neural_dependency_tracer(target: str, depth: int = 3, include_external: bool = False):
    # 1. BM25 search: Find exact import statements, require statements
    # 2. Semantic search: Find conceptually related dependencies
    # 3. AST patterns: Parse import trees, function calls, module references
    # 4. Intelligent fusion: Combine results with dependency-specific weighting
    return hybrid_dependency_graph
```

**Hybrid Advantage**:
- BM25 finds exact `import target` statements
- Semantic finds conceptually related code that depends on target functionality  
- AST patterns parse complex import structures and transitive dependencies

#### Tool 2: `neural_atomic_relations` (Hybrid)
```python
async def neural_atomic_relations(symbol: str, scope: str = "project"):
    # 1. BM25 search: Find exact symbol matches (def symbol, class symbol)
    # 2. Semantic search: Find conceptually related code and usage patterns
    # 3. AST patterns: Parse function/class definitions, method calls, inheritance
    # 4. Intelligent fusion: Symbol-specific weighting prioritizing exact matches
    return hybrid_symbol_relations
```

**Hybrid Advantage**:
- BM25 finds exact symbol definitions and literal usages
- Semantic finds conceptually related code that performs similar functions
- AST patterns understand code structure relationships

#### Tool 3: `neural_schema_analyzer` (Hybrid)  
```python
async def neural_schema_analyzer(source: str = "auto", detect_drift: bool = True):
    # 1. BM25 search: Find exact schema terms (CREATE TABLE, Model, migration)
    # 2. Semantic search: Find conceptually related database/schema code
    # 3. AST patterns: Parse ORM models, migration files, SQL syntax
    # 4. Intelligent fusion: Schema-specific weighting for structural precision
    return hybrid_schema_analysis
```

**Hybrid Advantage**:
- BM25 finds exact database schema statements
- Semantic understands database relationships and patterns
- AST patterns parse complex ORM models and migration structures

#### Tool 4: `neural_context_optimizer` (Hybrid)
```python
async def neural_context_optimizer(task: str, max_tokens: int = 4000, priority: str = "accuracy"):
    # 1. BM25 search: Find exact task-related terms and keywords
    # 2. Semantic search: Find conceptually relevant code for task context
    # 3. AST patterns: Understand code structure for optimal context boundaries
    # 4. Intelligent fusion: Context-specific weighting optimizing for token efficiency
    return hybrid_optimized_context
```

**Hybrid Advantage**:
- BM25 ensures exact keyword relevance for task requirements
- Semantic provides conceptual understanding of task context
- AST patterns ensure context boundaries respect code structure

### 2.2 Hybrid Search Pattern Templates
```
Standard Hybrid Tool Pattern:
1. Parse query intent (vibe vs technical vs mixed)
2. Execute parallel searches: BM25 + Semantic + AST 
3. Apply domain-specific fusion weights

5. Track performance metrics for continuous optimization
```
