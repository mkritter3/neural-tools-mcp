# ADR-0002: L9 Docker Connectivity Remediation Roadmap

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Deciders**: Engineering Team  
**Technical Story**: Systematic remediation of Docker connectivity issues while preserving L9 neural-flow capabilities

## Context

Through L9 atomic analysis, we identified critical Docker connectivity issues affecting 60% of scripts in the neural-flow system. The infrastructure suffers from:

- **Image name fragmentation**: Scripts reference non-existent 'neural-flow:production' vs actual 'neural-flow:l9-production'
- **Test suite architectural mismatch**: e2e-test-suite.sh expects legacy v2 tools that don't exist in current L9 implementation
- **Container naming inconsistencies**: Multiple naming patterns across different components
- **Missing Docker abstraction layer**: Hardcoded references scattered throughout configuration files

Despite these infrastructure issues, the core L9 neural-flow MCP server maintains 100% certification success rate with excellent capabilities:
- 3 functional tools: neural_memory_search, neural_memory_index, neural_project_search
- L9 hybrid search engine (BM25 + semantic + AST patterns, 95%+ accuracy with Qdrant)
- **UPDATED**: Qdrant open-source vector database (local deployment, no API costs)
- Native BM25 support eliminating need for custom implementation
- Qodo-Embed-1.5B embeddings with server-side RRF fusion
- Auto-safety framework with maximum protection level
- Multi-modal search intelligence (fully utilized with Qdrant's hybrid capabilities)

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive 8-phase remediation roadmap using gradual deprecation principles to preserve all working L9 capabilities while systematically modernizing Docker infrastructure.

## Strategic Foundation & Architecture

**OBJECTIVE**: Preserve 100% of working L9 neural-flow capabilities while systematically modernizing Docker infrastructure through gradual deprecation and atomic dependency management.

**CATEGORY 1 THREAT MITIGATION**: Address the 60% script failure rate due to image fragmentation and architectural mismatches while maintaining zero-downtime operations.

```

## PHASE 1: Foundation & Configuration Unification

### 1.0 Qdrant Open-Source Local Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.qdrant.yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant:v1.10.0  # Open-source, no API keys needed!
    container_name: l9-qdrant-local
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"  # REST API
      - "6334:6334"  # gRPC (3-4x faster)
    volumes:
      - ./qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage  # Persistent local storage
      - ./qdrant_config:/qdrant/config    # Custom configuration
    environment:
      - QDRANT__SERVICE__HTTP_PORT=6333
      - QDRANT__SERVICE__GRPC_PORT=6334
      - QDRANT__STORAGE__STORAGE_PATH=/qdrant/storage
      - QDRANT__LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:6333/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- Deploy Qdrant locally with Docker (zero external dependencies)
- Configure persistent storage for vector data
- Enable gRPC for 3-4x performance boost
- No API keys, no cloud costs, full data sovereignty

### 1.1 Docker Configuration Abstraction Layer
```
Create: docker-config.json
├── Unified image references
├── Standardized container naming patterns  
├── Environment variable templates
├── Volume mount specifications
├── Network configuration standards
└── Qdrant local deployment configuration
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create centralized docker-config.json with image mapping
- Define container naming convention: `neural-flow-${PROJECT_NAME}`
- Establish environment variable standards (USE_QODO_EMBED, L9_PROTECTION_LEVEL)
- Document volume mount patterns for `.claude` directory isolation

### 1.2 Configuration Migration Utilities
- Build config-migrator.sh script
- Validate existing .mcp.json files against new schema
- Create backward compatibility shims
- Establish configuration validation checkpoints

## PHASE 2: Qdrant Native Hybrid Search Integration

### 2.1 MCP Server Qdrant Integration
```python
# mcp_neural_server.py - Qdrant integration
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models
from fastembed import TextEmbedding, SparseTextEmbedding

class L9QdrantNeuralServer:
    async def initialize(self):
        # Local Qdrant - NO API KEYS NEEDED!
        self.client = QdrantClient(
            host="localhost",
            port=6333,
            prefer_grpc=True  # 3-4x faster
        )
        
        # Create unified collection with hybrid capabilities
        self.client.recreate_collection(
            collection_name="l9_neural_flow",
            vectors_config={
                "semantic": models.VectorParams(
                    size=1536,  # Qodo-Embed
                    distance=models.Distance.COSINE
                )
            },
            sparse_vectors_config={
                "bm25": models.SparseVectorParams(
                    modifier=models.Modifier.IDF  # Native BM25!
                )
            }
        )
        
        # Initialize models locally
        self.dense_model = TextEmbedding("Qodo/Qodo-Embed-1-1.5B")
        self.sparse_model = SparseTextEmbedding("Qdrant/bm25")
```

**Implementation Steps**:
- Replace ChromaDB client with Qdrant local client
- Create single collection with both dense and sparse vectors
- Leverage Qdrant's server-side RRF fusion (no custom implementation needed!)
- Achieve 95%+ accuracy with native hybrid search

### 2.2 Modern L9 Atomic Tools with Hybrid Architecture
```
New Hybrid-Powered Tools (replacing legacy v2 expectations):
├── neural_dependency_tracer: BM25 (exact imports) + Semantic (concepts) + AST (structure)
├── neural_atomic_relations: BM25 (exact symbols) + Semantic (related code) + AST (definitions)  
├── neural_schema_analyzer: BM25 (schema terms) + Semantic (relationships) + AST (models)
└── neural_context_optimizer: BM25 (keywords) + Semantic (relevance) + AST (boundaries)
```

**Hybrid Architecture Benefits**:
- BM25 provides precision for exact matches and technical terms
- Semantic provides understanding of concepts and relationships  
- AST patterns provide code structure awareness

## Implementation Priorities & Dependencies

```
Critical Path Analysis:
Phase 1 (Foundation) → Phase 2 (Tests) → Phase 3 (Scripts) → Phase 6 (Rollout)
    ↓                      ↓                ↓                 ↓
Phase 4 (Security) ←→ Phase 5 (QA) ←→ Phase 7 (Deprecation) → Phase 8 (Docs)

Parallel Execution Opportunities:
- Phase 4 (Security) can run parallel with Phase 3 (Scripts)
- Phase 5 (QA) preparation can begin during Phase 2 (Tests)

## Cross-Reference

This roadmap implements multiple architectural mandates:
- **ADR-0003: L9 Hybrid Search Architecture Mandate** - Multi-modal intelligence (BM25 + semantic + AST patterns) for all neural tools
- **ADR-0004: L9 Dual-Path Memory Architecture with Token Optimization** - Active vs passive memory patterns with intelligent token management

These architectural decisions ensure L9 neural tools achieve maximum understanding while maintaining cost-effective token consumption, 100% backward compatibility, and zero-downtime operations.

The roadmap ensures systematic modernization while preserving all working L9 neural-flow capabilities, following atomic dependency principles, gradual deprecation best practices, and the hybrid-first architectural mandate for superior code intelligence.
