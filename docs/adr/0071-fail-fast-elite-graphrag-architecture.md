# ADR-0071: Fail-Fast Elite GraphRAG Architecture

**Status:** APPROVED - CRITICAL
**Date:** 2025-09-22
**Context:** Post-Graphiti rollback, Elite GraphRAG implementation

## Context

Following the abandonment of ADRs 66-70 (Graphiti integration) and deep research into September 2025 elite GraphRAG standards, we identified that our current degraded mode architecture is fundamentally incompatible with elite GraphRAG operations that demand >1000 files/min indexing throughput and <100ms P95 query latency.

## Decision

**Remove degraded mode entirely and implement fail-fast architecture** across the neural indexing pipeline.

### Core Principles

1. **Elite Performance Standards (Sep 2025)**
   - Indexing: >1000 files/min
   - Query latency: <100ms P95
   - Precision: >90%
   - Data consistency: 100%

2. **Fail-Fast Philosophy**
   - All services must be available for operation
   - Immediate failure when any service is unavailable
   - No partial indexing or degraded states
   - Atomic operations across vector+graph storage

3. **Service Requirements**
   - Neo4j: Unified graph + vector storage (REQUIRED)
   - Nomic: Embeddings generation (REQUIRED)
   - All services operational or immediate failure
   - **Qdrant eliminated** per ADR-0066 consolidation strategy

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Degraded Mode Removal ✅ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Remove `self.degraded_mode` dictionary from IndexerService
- [ ] Remove `_handle_service_failure()` method
- [ ] Replace degraded mode checks with fail-fast exceptions
- [ ] Update service initialization to fail immediately if any service unavailable
- [ ] Modify indexing logic: both pipelines must succeed (semantic AND graph)

### Phase 2: Fail-Fast Architecture ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Implement atomic vector+graph transactions via WriteSynchronizationManager
- [ ] Add circuit breakers with immediate failure (no retry loops)
- [ ] Implement health checks with fail-fast on service unavailability
- [ ] Update error handling to propagate failures immediately

### Phase 3: Elite Performance Optimizations ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Implement semantic caching layer for <100ms queries
- [ ] Batch processing for >1000 files/min throughput
- [ ] Optimize Neo4j queries with GDS algorithms
- [ ] Add Qdrant binary quantization for speed

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Validation ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking (throughput, latency, precision)
- [ ] Alert systems for service failures
- [ ] E2E testing for elite performance targets
- [ ] SLA monitoring and enforcement

## Rationale

### Research Findings (Sep 2025 Standards)
- **Industry Consensus**: Elite GraphRAG systems have abandoned degraded mode
- **Data Consistency**: Partial indexing creates inconsistent knowledge graphs
- **Performance**: Degraded mode introduces latency overhead and complexity
- **Reliability**: Fail-fast provides clearer error signals and faster recovery

### Problems with Current Degraded Mode
1. **Silent Failures**: "59 files processed, 0 nodes created" with no alerts
2. **Inconsistent State**: Vector storage succeeds but graph storage fails
3. **Performance Overhead**: Constant degraded mode checks slow operations
4. **Complex Recovery**: Partial state recovery is error-prone
5. **False Success**: Metrics report success when only one pipeline works

### Benefits of Fail-Fast
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Failures are detected and reported instantly
2. **Data Consistency**: All-or-nothing operations ensure graph integrity
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Remove complex degraded mode state management
4. **Elite Performance**: No overhead from degraded mode checks
5. **Operational Clarity**: Clear service availability requirements

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
- Services must be 100% available for indexing operations
- No partial indexing capability
- Immediate failures when services are unavailable
- Requires robust service orchestration

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Remove degraded mode code while maintaining functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Implement fail-fast with graceful error handling
3. **Phase 3**: Add performance optimizations for elite targets
4. **Phase 4**: Full monitoring and SLA enforcement

### Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive service health monitoring
- Fast service recovery mechanisms
- Clear error messages for operational issues
- Robust CI/CD testing for service availability

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Elite GraphRAG performance (>1000 files/min, <100ms P95)
- ✅ 100% data consistency across vector+graph storage
- ✅ Simplified architecture with no degraded mode complexity
- ✅ Immediate failure detection and clear error signals
- ✅ Industry-standard fail-fast reliability patterns

### Negative
- ⚠️ No partial operation capability during service outages
- ⚠️ Requires 100% service availability for any operation
- ⚠️ More aggressive error handling may surface operational issues
- ⚠️ Breaking change for existing degraded mode workflows

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Research elite GraphRAG standards (Sep 2025)
- [x] Architectural decision documentation
- [x] ADR 66-70 marked as abandoned
- [x] Started degraded mode removal

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: Complete degraded mode removal from IndexerService
- [ ] Update initialization logic to fail-fast
- [ ] Modify indexing success criteria (both pipelines required)

### Next Steps
1. Complete degraded mode removal (5 remaining references)
2. Implement atomic transactions via WriteSynchronizationManager
3. Add performance monitoring for elite targets
4. E2E testing with fail-fast behavior
